Job Manager - Utility functions for job operations
===================================================

NOTE: Job creation and most job operations are now handled by tool_executor.py.
This module provides utility functions used by the orchestrator.

The job index is keyed by job_number (e.g., "25-180"), not conversation_id.
All job creation should go through tool_executor._job_create().
